                        <p>In this animated feature by noted Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki, 
                        10-year-old Chihiro and her parents stumble upon a seemingly abandoned amusement park.
                        After her mother and father are turned into giant pigs, Chihiro meets
                        the mysterious Haku, who explains that the park is a 
                        resort for supernatural beings who need a break from their time spent
                        in the earthly realm, and that she must work there to free herself 
                        and her parents.</p>

                        <p>Hiccup is a Norse teenager from the island of 
                        Berk, where fighting dragons is a way of life. His progressive
                        views and weird sense of humor make him a misfit, despite the 
                        fact that his father is chief of the clan. Tossed
                        into dragon-fighting school, he endeavors to prove himself as a 
                        true Viking, but when he befriends an injured dragon he names 
                        Toothless, he has the chance to plot a new course for his people's future.</p>

                        <p>Disillusioned knight Bowen befriends Draco 
                        , the last of the dragons, and the two begin 
                        scamming village folk as Bowen repeatedly "kills" Draco for money. 
                        Bowen soon learns that Draco is the same dragon who once saved his 
                        former student, now King Einon , from death by giving
                        him a piece of his heart. Einon is now a merciless tyrant, and Bowen
                        is compelled to stop him -- but the bond between king and dragon
                        means if one dies, the other does as well.</p>
