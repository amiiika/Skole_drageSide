        <h2>10 Mythical Dragons You Should Know About</h2>

            <div class="t1">
                <h1>1) Akhekh  </h1>
                <img src="../src/1.jpg"width="80%">
                    <p>Also known as Akhekhu, the <a href="http://www.blackdrago.com/fame/akhekhu.htm" target="_blank">Akhekh</a> is characterized as 
                    a fantastical beast with a long serpentine body that
                    is supported by its four legs. The mythical dragon
                    was said to reside in remote corners of the Egyptian 
                    lands, mainly around the fringe desert areas beside 
                    the fertile Nile valley. And interestingly enough, the 
                    tales of the Akhekh drake might have inspired the 
                    legends of the Griffins in Europe. This gradual 
                    evolution of folkloric traditions can be substantiated 
                    by the later depictions of the Akhekh – in which the 
                    creature maintains its serpentine profile with the 
                    ancient Egyptian headgear (Uraei), albeit with an 
                    antelope’s body and a bird’s head.</p>

                    <p>If the legend of the ‘Jason and the Argonauts’ was an 
                    adventure game, the <a href="https://www.theoi.com/Ther/DrakonKholkikos.html" target="_blank">Drakon Kholkikos</a> (or simply 
                    Colchian Dragon) would have been the main boss who 
                    guarded the Golden Fleece – that was located in the 
                    sacred grove of Ares at Kolkhis (present-day central 
                    Georgia). Described as having a crest, three tongues 
                    and a magical set of teeth, there are different versions 
                    as to how the mythical dragon met its untimely death – 
                    with some concluding with the ubiquitous scenario of the
                    hero slaying the dragon, and some alluding to a situation 
                    where the witch Medea puts the dragon to sleep with her 
                    magic. There is also a third version where the great singer
                    Orpheus lures the dragon with an enchanting musical rendition
                    on his lyre.</p>

                    of Bhutanese culture, mythology and monarchy. To that end, 
                    the elaborately scaled drake is prominently featured in Bhutan’s
                    national flag and national anthem (Druk tsendhen), while the 
                    Himalaya-nestled nation itself is called as Druk Yul (in Dzongkha),
                    which translates to the ‘Land of Druk’. The mythical dragon-inspired 
                    scope also extends to personal titles with the leaders of Bhutan 
                    being addressed as Druk Gyalpo or ‘Thunder Dragon Kings’. And, if 
                    you thought that was stretching things a bit – well, even all the 
                    political parties were named as ‘Druk Party’, for a mock election 
                    that was held in 2008.</p>

                <img src="../src/4.jpg"width="50%">
                    <p>Probably the most famous of all the dragons mentioned in this list, 
                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fafnir" target="_blank">Fafnir</a> (according to various sagas) oddly enough started out his 
                    life as a mere dwarf. He was the son of the Dwarf king Hreidmar, 
                    and was responsible for killing his own father to get hold of all
                    the wealth and treasure that was originally stolen from the æsir 
                    gods. However, after he had taken the valuables out of sheer 
                    greed, he was cursed by Andvari’s ring and gold among the loot 
                    (it was a trick played by Loki). This transformed him into a 
                    mighty mythical dragon with armored scales that couldn’t be 
                    penetrated by ordinary weapons (Smaug anyone?). Finally, it 
                    was Sigurd who slew him with his broken-sword, Gram, by finding 
                    a weak point along the soft underbelly of the gigantic beast.</p>

                <h1>5) Kukulkan</h1>
                <img src="../src/5.jpg"width="50%">
                    <p>Also known as <a href="https://www.realmofhistory.com/2019/04/20/quetzalcoatl-aztec-god/" target="_blank">Quetzalcoatl</a>, Kukulkan was worshiped as the great ‘feathered serpent’ 
                    god in the pantheon of Aztecs, Toltecs and the Mayans. The major 
                    deity (often taking the form of a mythical dragon-like entity)
                    seems to have played a multifaceted role while practicing his
                    ‘godly’ business. To that end, Kukulkan was the god of creation,
                    the sire of both the Morning and Evening Star, the protector
                    the craftsmen, the rain-maker, the wind-blower and also the 
                    fire-bringer. Interestingly, both the Mayans and the Aztecs
                    were not too keen on solar eclipses (given the sacredness
                    of the sun), as such their mythic traditions used to depict
                    such rare scenarios with the Earth Serpent swallowing the 
                    great Quetzalcoatl. Furthermore, as opposed to their cultural
                    penchant for human sacrifices, Kukulkan was supposedly not 
                    fond of such bloodthirsty practices.</p>

                <h1>6) Kur</h1>
                <img src="../src/6.jpg"width="70%">
                    <p>The primordial <p>
                    Also known as <a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/sum08.htm" target="_blank">Kur</a> is often considered as the first dragon within 
                    the web of vast literary traditions from Sumeria. He is described
                    as residing in the void above the earth’s layer and below the 
                    primal sea. The monstrous entity is also often related to the 
                    Sumerian concept of the underworld, and such, among its numerous
                    wicked exploits, the dragon once kidnapped the goddess Ereshkigal 
                    by taking her into his netherworld realm. The rescuing task fell
                    to a hero called Enki, and he successfully slew the mythical
                    dragon – a narrative which serves as a prologue to the renowned 
                    ‘Epic of Gilgamesh‘. Interestingly, the act of ‘slaying a dragon’
                    is a common motif repeated in later Babylonian traditions, which
                    might have also found its parallels or expansion (in tales) in
                    other parts of the world.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Python/python.html" target="_blank">Python</a> is depicted as the earth dragon that came from a slime in Delphi, 
                    while other sources claim the entity to be a female offspring of 
                    Gaia, the Earth goddess. She was described as being so humongous 
                    that her gargantuan coils stretched around the entire site of the
                    Delphi oracle – thus ably protecting her mother. She was also 
                    counted as one of the pets of Hera (wife of Zeus), and that gave
                    her the ‘privilege’ to cause harm and destruction to the 
                    surrounding lands, without getting punished. However, the 
                    happy romping sessions were finally curtailed by the Olympian 
                    deity Apollo, when he slew the mythical dragon with his weapon of
                    choice – the bow and arrow. The god of ‘light and sun’ also took 
                    over the stronghold of Delphi and grandly refurbished it with his
                    own predilections.</p>

                <h1>8) Stoor Worm</h1>
                <img src="../src/8.png"width="60%">
                    <p><a href="http://www.orkneyjar.com/folklore/stoor.htm" target="_blank">Stoor Worm</a> or Mester Stoor Worm (also known as Master Stoor Worm) is an
                    evil monster from Orcadian mythology (myths pertaining to the Orkney
                    Islands, north of Scotland), who is portrayed as having the fetid 
                    capacity to cause pestilence and contamination among both plants 
                    and animals. He was also known to be a glutton, and would randomly
                    pick seven victims from the nearby settlement for his weekly meal.
                    Fortunately, in an interesting turn of events, it was little boy 
                    named Assipattle, who killed the mythical dragon by going inside 
                    its belly with a boat and burning the creature’s liver. However, 
                    the scope of the Stoor Worm might go beyond this little tale, as 
                    some experts believe the monster dragon was an Orkney version of 
                    the famous Jörmungandr from Norse mythology (the World Serpent 
                    who is predicted to be killed by the mighty Thor during Ragnarok).</p>

                <img src="../src/9.jpg" width="80%">
                    <p>Mentioned in the ancient Aryan Vedic texts as the main adversary 
                    of the Indra (the king of Devas or ‘demi-gods’), <a href="https://allaboutdragons.com/dragons/Vritra" target="_blank">Vritra</a> was an 
                    Asura (a spirit that seeks power and dominance) who was represented 
                    as a mythical dragon-like entity. Also known by his Vedic name of
                    Ahi, which translates to ‘snake’, Vritra personified the droughts 
                    that ‘imprisoned’ numerous rivers and water bodies. On the other
                    hand, Indra was the God of thunderstorms and rain, and hence their
                    enmity is well justified within the literary scope. To that end, 
                    in an epic battle, Indra successfully destroyed 99 fortresses of 
                    the beast, and finally slew the dragon himself by breaking his 
                    jaw into two – with his imbued power being generated from an 
                    enchanted drink called ‘Soma’. This heroic feat finally led to
                    the freedom of the flowing rivers.</p>

                <img src="../src/10.jpg" width="40%">
                    <p><a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01058b.htm" target="_blank">Abrasax</a> (or Abraxas) is a well known term in Gnostic traditions,
                    where the entity is considered as the great ‘Archon’ or God. 
                    This makes etymological sense, since Abrasax in Greek translates
                    to ‘supreme being’, with the seven letters denoting the seven
                    primary planets. Even the Greek letters of the word add up to 
                    365, which pertains to the number of days in a year. However, 
                    beyond Gnostic traditions, the Abrasax might very well have had
                    its origin in Persian myths. According to numerous sources, the 
                    entity was often perceived as a demon (as opposed to a god), and
                    it was described physically as a hybrid between a mythical dragon 
                    and serpent, with a rooster’s head! Also, in an interesting note, 
                    it has been suggested that the whimsical word Abracadabra is derived
                    from Abrasax.</p>
